# USV-Control-System
The control system used to control the USV for my Engineerin Final Year project (skripsie).

The control system uses an Arduino DUE microcontroller. The other peripherals such as the compass, GPS and thrusters are detailed in the final report.
This is only the software for the control system and does not include any details on the hardware of the project.
